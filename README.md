# Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a visual blueprint of a webpage or app interface. It shows the layout and structure without focusing on color, graphics, or style. Wireframes are typically low-fidelity sketches that act as a foundation for design and development.

## Importance in the Design Process

Wireframes are essential in the design process for several reasons:

- **Clarify ideas early**: Help stakeholders and teams understand the intended structure before investing time in design or development.
- **Improve user experience**: Focus on content placement and user interaction flows.
- **Faster feedback**: Identify potential issues or improvements early on.
- **Better collaboration**: Align developers, designers, and clients with a shared visual plan.

## Conclusion

Wireframing is a critical first step in building successful digital products. It lays the groundwork for intuitive, user-centered design.
